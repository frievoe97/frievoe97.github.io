# Portfolio Template

This is my own html portfolio project, which everyone is welcome to use and develop further. If you use this project for your own internet presence, I would be very happy about a mention. The plan for the future is to use a script (possibly via python) with a few inputs from the user (name, email, menu items, etc.) to create and edit an own website. There will be a documentation for the editing. The documentation will be available for download and via the GitHub wiki. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me. **Even if you find bugs**. (friedrich.voelkers@me.com)

For some features you need an API key. This key is not included in the git repository because you have to create your own API key. To easily add your own API keys you need to create a file called "config.js" and add the following lines.

The file config.js should look like this:

```javascript
var config = {
  MY_USER : 'YOUR_USERNAME' // From your EmailJS-Account for the contact form
}
```

# Portfolio Template

This is my own html portfolio project, which everyone is welcome to use and develop further. If you use this project for your own internet presence, I would be very happy about a mention. The plan for the future is to use a script (possibly via python) with a few inputs from the user (name, email, menu items, etc.) to create and edit an own website. There will be a documentation for the editing. The documentation will be available for download and via the GitHub wiki. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me. **Even if you find bugs**. (friedrich.voelkers@me.com)

If you also want to use the contact form, you have to create the config.js file in the cloned git repository. This file contains all API keys. You can get the API key for the contact form from www.emailjs.com.

The file config.js should look like this:

```javascript
var config = {
  MY_USER : 'YOUR_USERNAME'
}
```

# Portfolio

This is my own html portfolio project, which everyone is welcome to use and develop further. If you use this project for your own internet presence, I would be very happy about a mention. The plan for the future is to use a script with a few inputs from the user (name, email, menu items, etc.) to create and edit an own website. There will be a documentation for the editing. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me. Even if you find bugs. (friedrich.voelkers@me.com)
